# Converting a bootstrap4 sample to react template

As part of my react learning, i decided to convert a bootstrap4 sample called  [JUMBOTRON](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/jumbotron/) into a react template.

Used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the application and aditional npm packets required by bootstrap:
- boostrap
- jquery
- popper.js

Just use npm install and npm start
